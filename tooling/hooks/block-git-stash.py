"""PreToolUse hook: refuse the mutating `git stash` subcommands.

WHY THIS EXISTS AS CODE AND NOT AS A SENTENCE
---------------------------------------------
`git stash` is shared across every worktree of a repository, because they all
share one `.git`. It is also shared across every agent session running
against that repository at the same time.

On a real wave, two agents each ran a revert-check stash inside the same
window and their working sets swapped: one agent's fix landed in the other's
worktree, and the other's work landed in the first. Both reported it as "my
edits silently vanished", and one nearly committed the other's changes.

This ban has been written into a shared wave brief, into an orchestration
skill, and verbatim into individual agent briefs, and it has still been
broken repeatedly by agents who had it in front of them, because every
instance was a revert check and stash is the reflex answer for that. A rule
broken repeatedly by people who read it is not a documentation problem, it is
a missing hook. The message this hook prints is the replacement recipe,
because a ban with no alternative loses to the reflex every time.

WHAT IT DOES NOT BLOCK
-----------------------
`git stash list` and `git stash show` are read-only and are allowed. Prose
that merely mentions the string (a brief being written, a grep, a docs edit)
is not a command invocation and is not matched: the pattern requires `git` in
command position.

CONTRACT
--------
Reads the PreToolUse payload on stdin, writes a JSON decision on stdout.
Silence plus exit 0 means "no opinion", which is the correct response to
everything except a mutating stash. It never blocks on its own failure: a
malformed payload or an unexpected exception exits 0 quietly, because a hook
that breaks the session when IT has a bug is worse than the bug it guards.

# keeps `grep "git stash"` and a heredoc full of prose from matching, while
# still catching `git -C <path> stash` and `git --no-pager stash`, whose
# option run is consumed by [^;&|\n]*? before `stash`.
#
# The env-assignment prefix is not hypothetical tidiness: an earlier version
# of this pattern omitted it, and `GIT_PAGER=cat git stash` walked straight
# through. A red test caught that before the hook was ever registered, which
# is the whole reason a guard needs a test with both arms.

# A `cat <<'EOF' ... EOF` heredoc is how a multi-line commit message is often

# DESCRIBES the ban -- quoting "never `git stash`", or narrating a fix to
# this very hook -- puts the words "git" and "stash" at the start of a
# heredoc BODY line, which is command position by _STASH's own rules (a line
# start, right after `\n`, counts). The message text is not a command; it is
# data `cat` echoes back out. This is scoped to `cat` specifically, not every
# heredoc: a heredoc fed to an interpreter (`bash <<EOF`, `sh <<EOF`,
# `python <<EOF`) has its body actually EXECUTED, and stripping THAT body from
# the scan would let a real mutating stash through undetected. `cat` never
# executes what it echoes, so it is the one consumer this hook can safely
# treat as message payload rather than more shell to check.

MESSAGE = """`git stash` is blocked in this repository. Use the patch file instead.

The stash stack is SHARED across every worktree and every concurrent agent
session, because they all share one .git. Two agents' working sets have
already swapped this way, and entries sitting in the stack right now may
belong to someone else.

For a revert check, which is almost always why this comes up:

    mkdir -p .scratch && git diff > .scratch/fix.patch   # keep the fix
    git checkout -- <the SOURCE files only>              # keep your new tests
    <run your targeted tests; they must go RED>
    git apply .scratch/fix.patch                         # restore
    git diff --stat                                      # prove byte-exact

To park work and switch context, `git checkout -b <branch>` preserves
uncommitted changes in place. To keep a copy, copy the files.

`git stash list` and `git stash show` are read-only and are not blocked."""
